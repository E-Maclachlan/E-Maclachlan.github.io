								<h3>Goddess Girls</h3>
								<p>"Managing constant communication is one of the biggest challenges of this industry. As my assistant, Eilidh has lifted much of that pressure from my team by handling correspondence with prospective clients, allowing us to take time off, avoid burn-out, and spend more time enjoying our work. She learned our business’s complex processes very quickly and was ready to start handling emails in just a few days. I trust her to handle any task I give her. Eilidh is sharp, organized, efficient, experienced, and exactly what we needed."</p>

								<h3>Faerie Willow</h3>
								<p>"Eilidh is the most fantastic assistant I could have hoped for. She is a boon to my mental health and having her bird-eye view of my business has been so helpful. Within the first 2 months of working together, I went from feeling burned out and stuck in a rut, to finding a new place to live & moving in! I genuinely don't know how I managed without her before! She is also very understanding about my neurodivergent brain and is always looking for ways to work with it, not against it. Also she gives me gold stars and is really funny. 24/10 would recommend."</p>

								<h3>Elise Kennedy</h3>
								<p>"I can’t speak highly enough of the service Eilidh gives - not only is she creative & efficient, she’s also the most switched-on person I’ve ever worked with in that I could say a mere few words of what I needed and she’d immediately exceed my expectations. I’m in awe of her and her talents, she delivers exactly as she promises - if not more - and is wonderful at relieving pressure that can hold you back. I came to her at the start of the week with an empty Reddit account and asked if she could help me - 7 days later I’ve reached nearly 300 karma. I’d have had 0 clue how to do this on my own. On top of this, she also subtitled a number of my videos, gave me advice, and was just there as a helpful ear whenever I needed. As a sex worker it can often feel like nobody is in your  corner but you - Eilidh has completely altered that for me. Knowing I have someone there whenever I need has changed the game. I appreciate her so much and can’t recommend her services more. Thank you Eilidh!!!"</p>

								<h3>Countess Diamond</h3>
								<p>"It can be quite daunting to pass your brand onto another person, but handing over the tasks that I don't have the time or skills for has improved my world for the better. I'd recommend Eilidh to everyone and anyone, she's everything you need from a PA, and while she works quickly, she is super organised and nothing is ever rushed. Her skill set is never-ending and there is nothing I feel she couldn't help with, I trust her implicitly. With Eilidh's help, both my personal brand Countess Diamond and my training and education platform Intellect Models has grown from strength to strength.”</p>

								<p>"I cannot recommend Eilidh enough, she helped me tick things off my to-do list that have been sat there for months!! She is efficient, friendly, organised and gets the work done super fast! I am so pleased with the service I received and really look forward to working with her again soon!"</p>
